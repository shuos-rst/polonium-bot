## configuring for a server
to get polonium to work, you need to add a a configuration file. create a file named ".env" in the same folder as polonium.py. the contents of the file should be the below code, with the token from the discord developer portal pasted directly after DISCORD_TOKEN=
```python
# .env
DISCORD_TOKEN=
```
then, run polonium.py from the command line.
