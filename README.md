## using polonium
run polonium.py in the command prompt.

the first time the bot is run, it will prompt you to enter a token (from the discord developer portal) and a prefix char (like ! or . or & -- the character that goes in front of each command).

to change the token or prefix char after the first time it's run, delete the .env file and run the bot again
