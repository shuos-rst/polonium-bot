## using polonium
to run the bot, run polonium.py in the command prompt. the first time the bot is run, it asks for a token (from the discord developer portal) and a prefix char (like ! or . or & -- the character that goes in front of each command)
to change the token or prefix char after the first time it's run, run config.py (the first time the bot is run, it does this on it's own)
